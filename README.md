# Portfolio
 Django portfolio made with [Get Started with Django: Build a Portfolio App by Martin Bruess @RealPython.com](https://realpython.com/courses/django-portfolio-project/)
## Goals
Finish this Django tutorial in order to get the basic structure down then I will style the portfolio as I want. I want to showcase some of my personal projects and school projects. I may also want to highlight my design skills as well.
